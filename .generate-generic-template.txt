You are helping create a generic troubleshooting template for piper CLI.

CONTEXT:
Piper is an evidence-first troubleshooting system. When users have an issue but we don't have a specialized template for it, we need a generic template with questions that work for ANY type of issue.

EXISTING CASE DATA:
We have a case (b9816a24) with:
- Problem: "RealDataTest" (deployment issue)
- Context: Azure DevOps
- Evidence: 22 files of logs, screenshots, YAML configs
- Questions asked:
  1. "Have you verified the Service Connection is authorized in Project Settings?" (Answered)
- Hypotheses generated:
  1. Deployment template has invalid parameter values or syntax errors
  2. Service principal lacks required permissions on target resource group
  3. Resource provider not registered in subscription

TASK:
Create a JSON template file called "generic.json" with 5-7 questions that would work for ANY troubleshooting scenario (not just Azure/deployment).

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Questions should be universal (work for web apps, APIs, databases, infrastructure, etc.)
2. Focus on fundamentals: What broke? When? What changed? What have you tried?
3. Each question needs:
   - id: "q1", "q2", etc.
   - ask: The question text
   - required: true/false
   - expectedFormat: "text"
   - guidance: How to find this information
   - examples: Array of 2-3 example answers
   - verificationRequired: true (for question 1 only)

4. Include 4-5 generic hypotheses that apply to most issues:
   - Configuration problems
   - Resource constraints
   - Dependency failures
   - Recent changes

5. Use this structure:
{
  "id": "generic",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "Generic Troubleshooting",
  "description": "General-purpose troubleshooting workflow for any issue type",
  "keywords": [],
  "errorPatterns": [],
  "questions": [...],
  "initialHypotheses": [...],
  "classification": "General",
  "metadata": {
    "createdAt": "2026-01-07T00:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-01-07T00:00:00.000Z",
    "usageCount": 0
  }
}
